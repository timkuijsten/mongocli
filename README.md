# mongovi

mongovi is a cli for MongoDB that uses libedit for line editing and [key bindings].

Status: **alpha**, only use it if you're not afraid to dive into the source code.


## Requirements:
* [MongoDB C Driver] 1.4.0
* [editline(3)] ships with OS X

Only tested with OS X 10.11, Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04.

## Installation

Download compile and install the mongo-c driver:
(Not needed on ubuntu, see below)

    $ curl -LO https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/download/1.4.0/mongo-c-driver-1.4.0.tar.gz
    $ sha256sum mongo-c-driver-1.4.0.tar.gz    # only proceed if this checksum matches
    2bc6ea7fd8db15250910a7c72da7d959e416000bec2205be86b52d2899f6951b  mongo-c-driver-1.4.0.tar.gz
    $ tar zxf mongo-c-driver-1.4.0.tar.gz
    $ cd mongo-c-driver-1.4.0/
    $ ./configure --enable-man-pages=yes
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ cd ~

Download compile and install mongovi:

    $ git clone https://github.com/timkuijsten/mongovi.git
    $ cd mongovi

### OS X 10.11

    $ make

### Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04

Make sure the needed libraries are installed before compiling

    $ sudo apt-get install libedit-dev libmongoc-dev libbson-dev
    $ make


## Usage examples

Open database *raboof* and collection *sabar*:

    $ ./mongovi raboof sabar
    /raboof/sabar > 

Use an empty query filter to list all documents:

    /raboof/sabar > {}
    { "_id" : { "$oid" : "57c6fb00495b576b10996f64" }, "foo" : "bar" }
    { "_id" : { "$oid" : "57c6fb00495b576b10996f65" }, "foo" : "baz" }
    /raboof/sabar > 

Use an aggregation query to list all documents without the _id field:

    /raboof/sabar > [{ $project: { _id: false, foo: true } }]
    { "foo" : "bar" }
    { "foo" : "baz" }
    /raboof/sabar > 

Same as previous, but filter on documents where *foo* is *bar*:

    /raboof/sabar > [{ $project: { _id: false, foo: true } }, { $match: { foo: "bar" } }]
    { "foo" : "bar" }
    /raboof/sabar > 


## Command-line options

    usage: mongovi database collection


## Interactive commands

* `dbs` list all databases
* `c` list all collections in the current database
* `c coll` change the current collection to "coll"
* `c /db/coll` change the current database to "db" and the collection to "coll"
* `count` count the number of documents in the current collection
* `update selector update` update using a selector document and update document
* `{...}` query filter, see [query operators]
* `[...]` aggregation pipeline, see [aggregation operators]

See [editline(7)] for a list of supported key bindings.


## ~/.mongovi

If this file exists, the first line is read and expected to be a valid mongodb
[connection string], possibly containing a username and password.


## Tests

    $ make test


## History

This project is a continuation of [node-mongovi]. *node-mongovi* always had a
limited set of key bindings and suffered from a lack of maintenance which became
more apparent with every new node and mongodb release. Furthermore, nodejs
shouldn't be a requirement for running a mongo cli.
